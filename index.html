                    <h5>Bill Irby - <span class="w3-opacity">December 16, 2020</span></h5>
                    <p>Only a few more days and 2020 will be history. Many of us will say "Thank the Lord!" But as we all know, every day of this life is precious and we really do thank the Lord for every day that we have.</p>
                    <p>Ginger and I are indeed thankful for the time we have had and are having with each of you. We want you to know how much we love all of you. The Christmas holidays are upon us and even though this usually great time of families together will be different this year, we pray that the holidays will be wonderful for each of you.</p>
                    <p>The year gone by has certainly been memorable though some of those memories we'd rather allow to drift away. At the same time, the fact that we can remember at all is a blessing! We remember family and friends we have lost but continue to love using the blessing of memory. We also think about those the Lord, using the minds and hands of our medical heroes, saved for us to love a while longer. And we thank God for the children He has allowed to come into our lives this year! What a blessing they are.</p>
                    <p>It is good now to remember the words of Psalm 118:24: "This is the day which the Lord has made; we will rejoice and be glad in it."</p>

                    <h3><b>What Are You Worth</b></h3>
                    <h5>Bill Irby - <span class="w3-opacity">December 16, 2020</span></h5>
                    <p>It is perhaps way too easy to come to negative conclusions about the way things are going these days. There is, after all, plenty of room for improvement from the point of view of God's righteousness as revealed in His Word. </p>
                    <p>However there are things that happen that encourage us. I ran across a document written by Jenny Renfroe, a student at the University of Alabama. Jenny, as you know, grew up in this congregation with her mom and dad (Kim and Patrick) and brothers (Nick and Michael).</p>
                    <p>In her article she answers the question "How do you measure your worth?" She argued, correctly, that what matters is your relationship with God and your soul. She wrote "In the end, it doesn't matter what you look like, how high your GPA is, what kind of car you drive, or how much money you make. The world might trick you into believing that these things define you. And they might measure you by these things, but God doesn't. God measures your heart."</p>
                    <p>She then lists "two qualities that show you what you're worth." The first is "You are made in the image of God" for which point Genesis 1:27 and Psalm 139:14 are quoted. From this she writes, "Society does a good job at making people think that they have to look or act a certain way to be accepted. Social media is full of 'flawless' celebrities and it is so easy to start comparing yourself to them. This can lead to the feeling of 'I am not enough.' If you ever find yourself feeling this way, remember your Creator."</p>
                    <p>The second quality she lists is "God loves you." She quoted Romans 5:8 and went on to write "You don't have to question your self-worth because God showed you exactly what you are worth. He says you are worth the blood of Christ. You are worth salvation. Even though you're imperfect, flawed and broken. How amazing is it that the same God that spoke the universe into existence loves you that deeply." </p>
                    <p>We are thankful for Jenny Renfroe and for the many young people and their fine families here at West Hobbs Street who live faithful Christian loves. Thank the Lord for all of them.</p>

                    <h3><b>Patience</b></h3>
                    <h5>Bill Irby - <span class="w3-opacity">December 7, 2020</span></h5>
                    <p>It would be fair to say that when it comes to this pandemic that our patience is running thin. Everybody I know is really tired of having to deal with the precautions and consequences of this last increase in the number of cases and hospitalizations. If you have been one who has had the virus you know it is no joke even if it is a relatively mild case. One thing that wears me out is the "news." All the talking heads are so full of condescension and panic that they are unbearable.</p>
                    <p>Then there is the pressure that comes when family and friends have the virus or have become exposed to someone who has been. It's about impossible to keep what we are supposed to do straight! A man given to impatience like me needs to remember what the Bible says about being patient!</p>
                    <p>The word most often translated as what we think of as patience in the New Testament has in it the idea of endurance and continuance and is sometimes rendered in that way. A good passage to think about is Romans 15:4-6: "For whatever things were written before were written for our learning, that we through the patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope. Now may the God of patience and comfort grant you to be like-minded toward one another, according to Christ Jesus, that you may with one mind and one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ."</p>
                    <p>This passage reveals some helpful things about patience and the related ability to endure in stressful circumstances. Let us remember that being a Christian in the first century was no piece of cake, no matter where one lived. Rome, in particular, had no hesitation in persecuting any group of people if it was deemed that the group could in any way challenge the authority of the empire. It was not always bad everywhere but things could and did get tough in a hurry.</p>
                    <p>So we find this passage in a context concerning bearing on another's burdens. Such behavior requires patience and endurance. Paul quotes Psalm 69:9: "The reproaches of those who reproached You fell on Me." When we read the Psalm we see that it is a lament of David in which he is upset that so many people think badly of him. He does not want the reproach that has descended on him to reflect on God. As Paul says here in Romans 15, David's words in this instance reflect the situation of Christ in His earthly ministry. He was reproached mightily by many people then. The Jewish establishment of the first century reproached God by rejecting Jesus as the Christ which was a reproach to Him.</p>
                    <p>Psalm 69 shows the stress David felt as he endured his many challenges, some even from family and friends. So that Scripture is one that can provide for us comfort and patience. Indeed many Old Testament accounts are like this. Allow Hebrews 11 to be an index to examples of suffering that were overcome by the faith and endurance of the sufferer.</p>
                    <p>One of the things that required the Romans to be patient was their tough spiritual environment. So Paul, after presenting the principle of relying on Scripture, encouraged them to glorify God with one united voice (Romans 15:5-6).</p>
                    <p>Of course, our situation is not the same. But we certainly are under some level of stress as a congregation. We have always enjoyed working and being together and are not able to do so as we'd like right now. It is frustrating to me and I know to you that we are limited in this way. Still from the point of view of Scripture it boils down to doing the best we can and being patient about our circumstances.</p>
                    <p>We might remember that Paul twice expressed his thankfulness for the patience and endurance of the church at Thessalonica in the first chapter of his two letters to them. Like them we can glorify God by being patient as individuals and as a congregation of God's people.</p>
