                    <h3><b>Internal Honesty</b></h3>
                    <h5>Bill Irby - <span class="w3-opacity">October 20, 2020</span></h5>
                    <p>"Well, to be honest with you...." "To tell you the truth....' How often have you heard someone begin a conversation with these words or some like them? Fact is (another similar formulation) not only have I heard them used I've used them myself. How about you?</p>
                    <p>Of course, we know what we are trying to do when we use these words: We want our hearers to know that we are giving then our best, most well-considered perspective on whatever subject is under consideration. So we preface it with these words to somehow place a stronger emphasis on what we are saying. But, should we?</p>
                    <p>Would it not be better to say what we mean and mean what we say? In Matthew 5:33-37 Jesus was dealing with the practice of swearing by heaven (God's throne) or earth (His footstool), or Jerusalem (the city of the King), or one's head (because we cannot make our hair white or black). So He said, "But let your 'yes' be 'yes' and your 'no' be 'no'." Is swearing by such things as these the same thing as saying, "Well, let me be honest with you"? Not precisely. But the two practices are related by the fact that they are both unnecessary. Just say what we mean and mean what we say.</p>
                    <p>The context of Matthew 5 is important here. Jesus is contrasting a number of elements of the way the Jews of the first century observed the Law of Moses with the way things would soon be under the New Covenant. Those men and women were of the strong opinion that they were doing just what God wanted them to do. That they were not is seen in that most of them did not see that Jesus fit all the prophetic qualifications to be the Christ, the Son of God. Peter saw it (Matthew 16:18) as did others of the righteous remnant who were avidly following and listening to the Lord.</p>
                    <p>But many in the religious establishment of Jerusalem did not. This section of Scripture is but one example. Instead of just saying what they meant in dealing with each other, the practice was to "ramp up" the importance of  what was said by dressing it up with an oath. The idea was that they did not really need to tell the whole truth if they did not attach an oath to what was said. It was like when kids say "I had my fingers crossed" or when grown folks say "I swear on a stack of Bibles."</p>
                    <p>The Lord's instruction is simple and powerful: just let your "yes" be "yes" and your "no" be "no." Jesus is certainly not saying that we should not explain what we say. No. His words here do demand that we be honest from the inside out.</p>
                    <p>Communication is destroyed when someone has an agenda that they keep hidden. If, for example, someone wants more than anything to be well thought of they will organize their conversation to reflect positively on themselves. Proverbs says that "As iron sharpens iron, so a man sharpens the countenance of his friend" (Proverbs 27:17). The doctor is really your friend when he tells you that you are obese and the preacher is your friend when he tells you that you are sinning. To do otherwise is to sugarcoat the truth.</p>
                    <p>All of this requires internal honesty. We must admit to ourselves what is going on inside our minds. This is what Paul did in all of his letters, most famously in Romans 7. Paul was brutally honest about himself and it jumps out at us. He was honest about his shortcomings but he also knew with absolute certainty that God would deliver him through the sacrifice of Jesus His Son.</p>
                    <p>When we let our yes be yes and no be no we reveal the honesty within us. And, like Paul, we can thank God for His grace when we realize that there are things within us that still need work.</p>

                    <h3><b>It was a Lonely and Dark Road</b></h3>
                    <h5>Bill Irby - <span class="w3-opacity">October 14, 2020</span></h5>
                    <p>Winfred Clark was a great friend, a superb gospel preacher, a faithful Christian and elder in the Lord's church. He is also the reason I came here to preach. I remember quite a few things he said. One in particular came to mind last night as I drove back home from teaching a class in Tennessee. Someone had asked brother Clark why he was "always on the road preaching" as she put it. His reply was, "That's what preachers do; they drive and they preach."</p>
                    <p>There is a stretch of road out of Tullahoma going toward Lynchburg that is rather lonely and dark. You have to stay alert for deer, too. It is really a rather fine drive unless it is raining and then it can be treacherous as can any two lane country road. Anyway, I enjoy that drive as well as the one down to Winfield through the Bankhead Forest. Dark and lonely though these roads may be they do get us where we are going.</p>
                    <p>Traveling as I do puts me in mind of how a road can represent life. Now, good roads anything like we have were an extreme rarity in the first century. The Romans were famous for building roads but our Interstate system would shock even them. But we find the idea of traveling a certain path or way is common in the New Testament.</p>
                    <p>John made good use of this set of ideas in 1 John 1:7: "But if we walk in the light as He if in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin." As Christians we endeavor to walk in that light, the light of Christ, the light of His Word (Psalm 119:105). We need that light for our path.</p>
                    <p>The road of life is and will be from time to time dark and lonely. It will sometimes be outright dangerous. Our light, God's Word, can help illuminate possible dangers if we will use it. Obviously the chief spiritual danger we face on life's road is sin. "All have sinned and come short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23). Sin results in spiritual death (Romans 6:23). </p>
                    <p>When the sky is clear and the road open and safe we do not think too much about the dangers that could be just around the next corner. We might almost be home from a long journey and thus let down our guard when trouble strikes (I hit a deer some years ago just a few hundred feet from the Athens exit). So it is when it comes to sin. We may do very well spiritually for a good long time but we can never allow ourselves to be unwary.</p>
                    <p>Of course, sin has many categories. What "gets us" might not be like a big old buck in the road; it may be something more subtle. Pride, for example. A lack of humility might allow us to think we can drive too fast, or perhaps even worse, for too long a time.</p>
                    <p>The spiritual road of life has plenty of enough dark and foreboding places at best. We do not need to make it more dangerous by thinking we have the means within ourselves to get to our destination without God's help. One favorite passage in Hebrews says "For He Himself has said, 'I will never leave you nor forsake you.' So that we may boldly say: 'The Lord is my helper; I will not fear. What can man do to me?'" (NKJV). No, He will not leave us alone on life's road; but we need to be sure that we do not leave Him.</p>
                    <p>So I am driving along thinking about these things and then I realized that I could easily have an accident doing the best I can! A big truck could take me out! Now I do not want that to happen and I do my best to stay safe on the road. But if it did happen to me, or to you, we would be OK. Why? How? Because God is with His children the whole length of the road of life. He will be with us on the bright clear days and He is with us on the dark lonely nights. Let's be sure to stay with Him.</p>
