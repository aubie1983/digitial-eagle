                    <h3><b>Patience</b></h3>
                    <h5>Bill Irby - <span class="w3-opacity">December 7, 2020</span></h5>
                    <p>It would be fair to say that when it comes to this pandemic that our patience is running thin. Everybody I know is really tired of having to deal with the precautions and consequences of this last increase in the number of cases and hospitalizations. If you have been one who has had the virus you know it is no joke even if it is a relatively mild case. One thing that wears me out is the "news." All the talking heads are so full of condescension and panic that they are unbearable.</p>
                    <p>Then there is the pressure that comes when family and friends have the virus or have become exposed to someone who has been. It's about impossible to keep what we are supposed to do straight! A man given to impatience like me needs to remember what the Bible says about being patient!</p>
                    <p>The word most often translated as what we think of as patience in the New Testament has in it the idea of endurance and continuance and is sometimes rendered in that way. A good passage to think about is Romans 15:4-6: "For whatever things were written before were written for our learning, that we through the patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope. Now may the God of patience and comfort grant you to be like-minded toward one another, according to Christ Jesus, that you may with one mind and one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ."</p>
                    <p>This passage reveals some helpful things about patience and the related ability to endure in stressful circumstances. Let us remember that being a Christian in the first century was no piece of cake, no matter where one lived. Rome, in particular, had no hesitation in persecuting any group of people if it was deemed that the group could in any way challenge the authority of the empire. It was not always bad everywhere but things could and did get tough in a hurry.</p>
                    <p>So we find this passage in a context concerning bearing on another's burdens. Such behavior requires patience and endurance. Paul quotes Psalm 69:9: "The reproaches of those who reproached You fell on Me." When we read the Psalm we see that it is a lament of David in which he is upset that so many people think badly of him. He does not want the reproach that has descended on him to reflect on God. As Paul says here in Romans 15, David's words in this instance reflect the situation of Christ in His earthly ministry. He was reproached mightily by many people then. The Jewish establishment of the first century reproached God by rejecting Jesus as the Christ which was a reproach to Him.</p>
                    <p>Psalm 69 shows the stress David felt as he endured his many challenges, some even from family and friends. So that Scripture is one that can provide for us comfort and patience. Indeed many Old Testament accounts are like this. Allow Hebrews 11 to be an index to examples of suffering that were overcome by the faith and endurance of the sufferer.</p>
                    <p>One of the things that required the Romans to be patient was their tough spiritual environment. So Paul, after presenting the principle of relying on Scripture, encouraged them to glorify God with one united voice (Romans 15:5-6).</p>
                    <p>Of course, our situation is not the same. But we certainly are under some level of stress as a congregation. We have always enjoyed working and being together and are not able to do so as we'd like right now. It is frustrating to me and I know to you that we are limited in this way. Still from the point of view of Scripture it boils down to doing the best we can and being patient about our circumstances.</p>
                    <p>We might remember that Paul twice expressed his thankfulness for the patience and endurance of the church at Thessalonica in the first chapter of his two letters to them. Like them we can glorify God by being patient as individuals and as a congregation of God's people.</p>

                    <h3><b>You Can't Have Too Many</b></h3>
                    <h5>Bill Irby - <span class="w3-opacity">November 30, 2020</span></h5>
                    <p>The present distress has taught us many lessons. Early on we saw that many of our fellow citizens were determined to keep a ready supply of paper goods on hand, so much so that even now signs in the store remind us not to hoard. Along the way we learned that you cannot have too many cough drops or vitamins or even old fashioned aspirin tablets.</p>
                    <p>More seriously we also learned that you cannot have too much access to healthcare when you really need it. A corollary to this is that we have come to appreciate the work done by all the folks who work in hospitals, clinics and doctor’s offices. Their normal days are hard enough but then imagine adding the pressure the virus has put on the system. We realize that we cannot have too many people who have chosen to be nurses, doctors, medical tech and helpers of all kinds. Thank God for all of our medical people.</p>
                    <p>In a more general way times like these make us realize that you really cannot have too many people who love you. We know there are folks out there who are alone. For the longest time we have not been able to come and go to the hospitals and nursing homes to visit as we all once did on a regular basis. Then there is the separation that many experience out of a combination of distance and caution. Of course the love is still there; we just have to find different ways to show it.</p>
                    <p>On the subject of folks and love, let’s turn that equation around for a bit. We often think about having plenty of folks who love us but even more important is that we have plenty of folks to love. We often quote Jesus from John 13:34: “A new commandment I give unto you, that you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another.”</p>
                    <p>Note that the Lord did not emphasize living in such a way so as to encourage others to love you. Being loveable is certainly a very good idea. But the commandment from Jesus is for those who are His disciples to love one another. Now we do not miss the point that if we do love others that others who are following the directive will ultimately love us. We can only love others; we cannot make others love us.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, some folks miss the point of Jesus’ words altogether. I know this because I’ve met with many folks who have the complaint that people do not love them like they should. Some say “My wife doesn’t love me like she should” or “The people at church do not love me like I ought to be loved.” Another variation on this theme is “People are not friendly to me.”</p>
                    <p>Well, there is nothing new in this old preacher’s response: I always suggest that they forget about what they think they are not getting in the way of love and attention and start loving others. Such folks must learn to forget about the love they think they receive or do not receive and concentrate on just giving love to others. John 13:34 does not involve a ledger of examples of love coming in and going out.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, the Christian life has nothing at all to do with a balance sheet of love given and received. It is all about doing all the giving you can do and let the rest take care of itself. We remember the complaint of the selfish Christian who wondered what the church had done for him lately. Nothing like that could be more distinctly removed from the proper spirit of the Christian faith. Our job is to love one another without concern for a return on that investment. The Lord will take care of all of that.</p>
                    <p>So, no, we cannot have too many people to love. We cannot get through bad times or good without people to love. And if you are alone for the moment, look around. It will not hard at all to find someone who can use a kind word, a call or an act of loving kindness. Such acts of love make the gloom of the very worst of days disappear.</p>

                    <h3><b>Some More Virus Thoughts</b></h3>
                    <h5>Bill Irby - <span class="w3-opacity">November 23, 2020</span></h5>
                    <p>Well the virus made a visit to Ginger and me. We have been blessed thus far to have a mild experience with it, much milder than many folks have experienced. We are thankful. So many of our friends and fellow citizens have suffered serious symptoms and wide ranging consequences of this virus. We must continue to pray for them and help when we can. Ginger and I appreciate the many kind words and offers of help.</p>
                    <p>I cannot help but think about the spiritual implications of this virus and what it is doing to folks. We all know that this is just a reminder of the truth that is always before us: life, as sweet as it is, does not go on forever. As James said, “yet you do not know what tomorrow may bring. What is your life? It is even a vapor that appears for a little time and vanishes away” (4:14).</p>
                    <p>It may seem to be somewhat negative to bring this reality to mind. But we get ourselves in all sorts of trouble when we turn our backs on the reality of life. God is the Designer of life and He designed into life the ability to teach lessons that we must learn if we are to live this life properly. Keeping the truth that life is a vapor in mind helps us value each moment we have.</p>
                    <p>Another thing that comes to mind in times like these is that God is always with us. Remember Paul‘s great sermon on Mars Hill recorded in Acts 17. He told the learned gathering that God had “made of one blood all nations of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, and determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation; that they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after Him and find Him, though He be not far from every one of us; For in Him we live, and move, and have our being” (17:26-28).</p>
                    <p>The passage teaches us that God made us and this world and that He is fully aware of the scope of possible interactions between the two creations. We cannot allow ourselves to be surprised by the challenges of this life. God has allowed multiplied thousands of examples to flood everyone’s experience to remind us of the nature of this existence. God knows we will have tough days. We must allow those days to push us closer to God. He is, after all, right close.</p>
                    <p>Of course many folks do not care for the Biblical picture of God. There are circles even within the Christian religion that see God as only beneficial in this life. The idea is that if I have to suffer any at all then God is not doing His job. Invariably all of us have to suffer. The result of that suffering can be the rejection of God. It is not true that God will protect us from all suffering. There is no Biblical example of Him operating in such a fashion. We cannot name a good Biblical character up to and including our Savior who did not suffer.</p>
                    <p>The sad truth is that people miss the blessing of believing the real truth about God. If we reject the truth about God we will never know God. The only way to know God is to know what the Bible says about Him. The living and active Word teaches us who God is. If we attempt to move through this life thinking that God is simply going to run interference against our problems we will be very disappointed.</p>
                    <p>So what should we expect from God in times like these. There are three things. One, He provides us the means to look past the immediate to the future. Things may get better and they often do. Two, He provides us the strength to face really big trouble. This strength comes from knowing the Biblical accounts of those who faced problems successfully. And three, He, through the church, provides us a fellowship of faithful believers who help us make it through the toughest of days.</p>
