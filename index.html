                    <h3><b>The Value of a Good Name</b></h3>
                    <h5>Bill Irby - <span class="w3-opacity">November 10, 2020</span></h5>
                    <p>I have told this story more than once but I feel the need to repeat it. I had walked down to the newstand in the small Virginia town where I was born and where my grandparents lived. My grandfather Irby had given me a dollar which of course I had to spend as soon as possible and the newstand had a large selection of comic books. We do not have newstands as much these days but they were wonderful places back then. I made my purchase and was walking back to the house when an older gentleman stopped me. He said, "Son, whose boy are you?" For some reason (probably because it was his dollar I had spent) I said, "My grandfather is Anslem Lee Irby." The old fellow then patted me on the head and said "Good boy."</p>
                    <p>I did not understand what had happened back then but maybe I do now. The gentleman saw a kid by himself on the street and was concerned. Once he heard my grandfather's name he was satisfied about the circumstances. That was my early introduction to the value of a good name.</p>
                    <p>The Bible has quite a bit to say about names and their significance. Ecclesiastes 7:1 has "A good name is better than precious ointment." Proverbs 22:1 reads, "A good name is to be chosen rather than great riches." God's Word teaches that a good name and the good reputation implied by a good name is more valuable that material riches.</p>
                    <p>There is a lot to see in the value of specific names in the Bible. Biblical names are usually descriptive and important. An outstanding example is God's reply to Moses in Exodus 3:14. Moses was thinking ahead about how to identify God when he spoke with the children of Israel. Moses wanted to know God's name. God identified Himself as "I AM Who I AM" and went on to say for Moses to tell them that "I AM" had sent Moses to them.</p>
                    <p>This name is without doubt the most powerfully descriptive self-identification in all of written word. "I AM" is simply the first person singular of the present tense of the verb "to be." It is an expression of a state of being that has no beginning and no end. God is. Nobody else is like God is. And all of this is wrapped up in His name.</p>
                    <p>We remember from Matthew 1 that Mary was visited by the angel of the Lord who told her what was about to happen. Two names are mentioned in that context, both with great value and importance. She was to call the baby "Jesus." That name literally means "savior." As the angel said, "for He will save His people from their sins." Matthew adds the reference to Isaiah 7:14 concerning the truth that the marriage of Joseph and Mary had not yet been consummated. "Behold, the virgin shall be with child and bear a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel." Matthew translated Immanuel for us: It means God with us.</p>
                    <p>So with the two names, Jesus and Immanuel, we have before us the  truth that Jesus is our Savior and that He was indeed God who has come here to save us. As John said, "the Word became flesh and dwelt among us" (John 1:14). Perhaps this is why Peter, filled as he was with the Holy Spirit, chose to say what he did about the name of Jesus of Nazareth before the Sanhedrin: "Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name given among men by which we must be saved" (Acts 4:12).</p>
                    <p>The apostle Paul knew that his choice to live by the name of Jesus was the right one. We can know the same thing. People in the here and now might not agree but one day they will know. Philippians 2:9 hearkens back to the naming of Jesus and says that "God has given Him the name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth and those under the earth, and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father." What a name!</p>

                    <h3><b>Elevate Your Foundation</b></h3>
                    <h5>Bill Irby - <span class="w3-opacity">November 2, 2020</span></h5>
                    <p>We have been considering the Sermon on the Mount from the perspective of the elevation of spiritual standards. It seems that in many ways our modern culture is not at all interested in elevation of standards of any kind and certainly not spiritual ones. Any number of examples could be cited. The society seems more rude, academic standards are diminished and people seem to care less about how they act and how their actions might affect others.</p>
                    <p>But to be fair we have to remember that humanity has gone through this civilization cycle many times and unless the Lord decides to close out our existence it is likely that the cycle will continue. Every nation has had atg least some shameful moments and the planet still has an ample share of bad actors. The Dark Age of centuries past may not have been the last.</p>
                    <p>The answer to this dilemma is the elevation of spiritual standards. Jesus preached case after case of ways He intended for His disciples to improve the way they thought and acted. At the end of the Sermon He provided the overall key: "Therefore whoever hears these sayings of Mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man who built his house on a rock" (Mathew 7:24NKJV).</p>
                    <p>Many of us have been singing a great song about this very thing for a long time. The rain, floods and wind could not dislodge this man's house because he had built it on a rock. We know what happened to the house that was built on the sand! His house had a great fall because the foolish builder heard what Jesus said but did not do it!</p>
                    <p>Doing the "sayings of the Lord" is the one and only way to truly elevate our foundation. It may seem strange to speak of elevating something that is to undergird everything else but that is exactly what we ought to do. The "sand" here is worldliness, selfishness and materialism. A foundation made of such things will not hold up. To elevate our foundation we have to look in a place most folks do not think to look.</p>
                    <p>That place is Jesus Christ and the His Word. Remember John 1:1: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." John told us that "the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth" (John 1:14). Later in his gospel John quoted the Lord: "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life" (3:16).</p>
                    <p>As we know the Sermon on the Mount was preparatory for the establishment of the church, the kingdom of God. Jesus did indeed give His life so that we could have hope of eternal life. We cannot and do not earn that gift of grace. But we must indeed obey our Lord. Jesus said, "If you love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15).</p>
                    <p>To make sure that we can do that very thing God has made sure that we have His Word. We have it and it is "living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edge sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart" (Hebrews 4:12).</p>
                    <p>There is a distinct and real connection between the Word that became flesh and the Word we have in written form. The Lord was the Word Who saw to it that the written Word was produced (2 Timothy 3:16-17). Thus we elevate the foundation of our lives by hearing and doing the Words of the Lord.</p>

                    <h3><b>The Elevation of Standards</b></h3>
                    <h5>Bill Irby - <span class="w3-opacity">October 26, 2020</span></h5>
                    <p>There are many ways to approach the study of the Sermon on the Mount from Matthew 5-7. This is as it should be because these words from Jesus are deep, timeless and sublime.</p>
                    <p>The context is well-known to Bible students. Jesus is preparing His disciples for the beginning of the New Covenant. He was preaching "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand" (Matthew 4:17) and He told His hearers that He did not come to destroy the Law and the Prophets but to fulfill them (Matthew 5:17). Paul told us that the Law of Moses was as good as it could be but the gospel is the power of God unto salvation (Romans 1:16, as well as all of Romans and Galatians). In the Sermon on the Mount Jesus asked His disciples to elevate the standards by which they were living.</p>
                    <p>We must remember that many of the Lord's hearers during His earthly ministry had a rather materialistic understanding of the Law of Moses. The Pharisees in particular understood it as a sort of "cause and effect" document. Some of them thought "if I do this, then God will do that." Their sense of it caused them to think of themselves as able to earn their relationship with God and to think much more of their spiritual standing than they should. In essence they had made the Law of Moses into a contract that benefited them and them alone.</p>
                    <p>Their understanding was badly warped. Matthew 5 begins with a reference to "the multitudes." The Lord knew that among these people were those who had this twisted view of the Law of Moses. From our perspective the approach He took to help them is incredibly powerful. He moved them away from a materialistic approach to their relationship with God to the proper and spiritual one.</p>
                    <p>In this way we can understand that the Sermon on the Mount was the series of lessons that readied the people for the coming of the kingdom of heaven and thus the establishment of the church. A few years back I stood where scholars say this took place on the northwestern shore of the Sea of Galilee. As you can imagine it was awe inspiring to stand there and think of the words being said by the Lord Himself. We know from reading the whole of the New Testament that everybody did not "get" what He was saying in the immediate term. But what He said there can be correctly said to have begun to change the world.</p>
                    <p>Not only did Christianity change the world for the better the principles taught by the Lord Jesus can continue to do so as there is obviously still room for improvement. The approach Jesus used is timeless and universally applicable in that, as we have said, He called for the people to elevate the standards by which they were living. We can always do this. For them, they needed to know that, yes, the Old Law was good but the New Covenant would be better. The distinction between the two, particularly as the Old Law was practiced by many in His audience, was one of material versus spiritual.</p>
                    <p>Bible students know the Sermon starts with the Beatitudes. The verses in Matthew 5:3-12 each begin with the word "blessed." We know that Christians today, living as we do in and under the New Covenant Jesus died to establish, have many blessings, both material and spiritual. Jesus asked his hearers to think of blessedness in an eternal, primarily spiritual way. We would do well to remember this.</p>
                    <p>He spoke of humility, mournful seriousness, meekness, righteousness, mercy, purity, peace, and being persecuted for right reasons. According to the Lord real abiding blessedness has nothing to do with houses, banks or being famous. Blessedness comes from elevating one's standards way up away from the material to those spiritual values He listed. Everybody, no matter the circumstance, can be blessed by this elevation of standards.</p>
