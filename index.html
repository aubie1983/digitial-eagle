                    <h3><b>Elevate Your Foundation</b></h3>
                    <h5>Bill Irby - <span class="w3-opacity">November 2, 2020</span></h5>
                    <p>We have been considering the Sermon on the Mount from the perspective of the elevation of spiritual standards. It seems that in many ways our modern culture is not at all interested in elevation of standards of any kind and certainly not spiritual ones. Any number of examples could be cited. The society seems more rude, academic standards are diminished and people seem to care less about how they act and how their actions might affect others.</p>
                    <p>But to be fair we have to remember that humanity has gone through this civilization cycle many times and unless the Lord decides to close out our existence it is likely that the cycle will continue. Every nation has had atg least some shameful moments and the planet still has an ample share of bad actors. The Dark Age of centuries past may not have been the last.</p>
                    <p>The answer to this dilemma is the elevation of spiritual standards. Jesus preached case after case of ways He intended for His disciples to improve the way they thought and acted. At the end of the Sermon He provided the overall key: "Therefore whoever hears these sayings of Mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man who built his house on a rock" (Mathew 7:24NKJV).</p>
                    <p>Many of us have been singing a great song about this very thing for a long time. The rain, floods and wind could not dislodge this man's house because he had built it on a rock. We know what happened to the house that was built on the sand! His house had a great fall because the foolish builder heard what Jesus said but did not do it!</p>
                    <p>Doing the "sayings of the Lord" is the one and only way to truly elevate our foundation. It may seem strange to speak of elevating something that is to undergird everything else but that is exactly what we ought to do. The "sand" here is worldliness, selfishness and materialism. A foundation made of such things will not hold up. To elevate our foundation we have to look in a place most folks do not think to look.</p>
                    <p>That place is Jesus Christ and the His Word. Remember John 1:1: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." John told us that "the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth" (John 1:14). Later in his gospel John quoted the Lord: "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life" (3:16).</p>
                    <p>As we know the Sermon on the Mount was preparatory for the establishment of the church, the kingdom of God. Jesus did indeed give His life so that we could have hope of eternal life. We cannot and do not earn that gift of grace. But we must indeed obey our Lord. Jesus said, "If you love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15).</p>
                    <p>To make sure that we can do that very thing God has made sure that we have His Word. We have it and it is "living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edge sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart" (Hebrews 4:12).</p>
                    <p>There is a distinct and real connection between the Word that became flesh and the Word we have in written form. The Lord was the Word Who saw to it that the written Word was produced (2 Timothy 3:16-17). Thus we elevate the foundation of our lives by hearing and doing the Words of the Lord.</p>

                    <h3><b>The Elevation of Standards</b></h3>
                    <h5>Bill Irby - <span class="w3-opacity">October 26, 2020</span></h5>
                    <p>There are many ways to approach the study of the Sermon on the Mount from Matthew 5-7. This is as it should be because these words from Jesus are deep, timeless and sublime.</p>
                    <p>The context is well-known to Bible students. Jesus is preparing His disciples for the beginning of the New Covenant. He was preaching "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand" (Matthew 4:17) and He told His hearers that He did not come to destroy the Law and the Prophets but to fulfill them (Matthew 5:17). Paul told us that the Law of Moses was as good as it could be but the gospel is the power of God unto salvation (Romans 1:16, as well as all of Romans and Galatians). In the Sermon on the Mount Jesus asked His disciples to elevate the standards by which they were living.</p>
                    <p>We must remember that many of the Lord's hearers during His earthly ministry had a rather materialistic understanding of the Law of Moses. The Pharisees in particular understood it as a sort of "cause and effect" document. Some of them thought "if I do this, then God will do that." Their sense of it caused them to think of themselves as able to earn their relationship with God and to think much more of their spiritual standing than they should. In essence they had made the Law of Moses into a contract that benefited them and them alone.</p>
                    <p>Their understanding was badly warped. Matthew 5 begins with a reference to "the multitudes." The Lord knew that among these people were those who had this twisted view of the Law of Moses. From our perspective the approach He took to help them is incredibly powerful. He moved them away from a materialistic approach to their relationship with God to the proper and spiritual one.</p>
                    <p>In this way we can understand that the Sermon on the Mount was the series of lessons that readied the people for the coming of the kingdom of heaven and thus the establishment of the church. A few years back I stood where scholars say this took place on the northwestern shore of the Sea of Galilee. As you can imagine it was awe inspiring to stand there and think of the words being said by the Lord Himself. We know from reading the whole of the New Testament that everybody did not "get" what He was saying in the immediate term. But what He said there can be correctly said to have begun to change the world.</p>
                    <p>Not only did Christianity change the world for the better the principles taught by the Lord Jesus can continue to do so as there is obviously still room for improvement. The approach Jesus used is timeless and universally applicable in that, as we have said, He called for the people to elevate the standards by which they were living. We can always do this. For them, they needed to know that, yes, the Old Law was good but the New Covenant would be better. The distinction between the two, particularly as the Old Law was practiced by many in His audience, was one of material versus spiritual.</p>
                    <p>Bible students know the Sermon starts with the Beatitudes. The verses in Matthew 5:3-12 each begin with the word "blessed." We know that Christians today, living as we do in and under the New Covenant Jesus died to establish, have many blessings, both material and spiritual. Jesus asked his hearers to think of blessedness in an eternal, primarily spiritual way. We would do well to remember this.</p>
                    <p>He spoke of humility, mournful seriousness, meekness, righteousness, mercy, purity, peace, and being persecuted for right reasons. According to the Lord real abiding blessedness has nothing to do with houses, banks or being famous. Blessedness comes from elevating one's standards way up away from the material to those spiritual values He listed. Everybody, no matter the circumstance, can be blessed by this elevation of standards.</p>

                    <h3><b>Internal Honesty</b></h3>
                    <h5>Bill Irby - <span class="w3-opacity">October 20, 2020</span></h5>
                    <p>"Well, to be honest with you...." "To tell you the truth....' How often have you heard someone begin a conversation with these words or some like them? Fact is (another similar formulation) not only have I heard them used I've used them myself. How about you?</p>
                    <p>Of course, we know what we are trying to do when we use these words: We want our hearers to know that we are giving then our best, most well-considered perspective on whatever subject is under consideration. So we preface it with these words to somehow place a stronger emphasis on what we are saying. But, should we?</p>
                    <p>Would it not be better to say what we mean and mean what we say? In Matthew 5:33-37 Jesus was dealing with the practice of swearing by heaven (God's throne) or earth (His footstool), or Jerusalem (the city of the King), or one's head (because we cannot make our hair white or black). So He said, "But let your 'yes' be 'yes' and your 'no' be 'no'." Is swearing by such things as these the same thing as saying, "Well, let me be honest with you"? Not precisely. But the two practices are related by the fact that they are both unnecessary. Just say what we mean and mean what we say.</p>
                    <p>The context of Matthew 5 is important here. Jesus is contrasting a number of elements of the way the Jews of the first century observed the Law of Moses with the way things would soon be under the New Covenant. Those men and women were of the strong opinion that they were doing just what God wanted them to do. That they were not is seen in that most of them did not see that Jesus fit all the prophetic qualifications to be the Christ, the Son of God. Peter saw it (Matthew 16:18) as did others of the righteous remnant who were avidly following and listening to the Lord.</p>
                    <p>But many in the religious establishment of Jerusalem did not. This section of Scripture is but one example. Instead of just saying what they meant in dealing with each other, the practice was to "ramp up" the importance of  what was said by dressing it up with an oath. The idea was that they did not really need to tell the whole truth if they did not attach an oath to what was said. It was like when kids say "I had my fingers crossed" or when grown folks say "I swear on a stack of Bibles."</p>
                    <p>The Lord's instruction is simple and powerful: just let your "yes" be "yes" and your "no" be "no." Jesus is certainly not saying that we should not explain what we say. No. His words here do demand that we be honest from the inside out.</p>
                    <p>Communication is destroyed when someone has an agenda that they keep hidden. If, for example, someone wants more than anything to be well thought of they will organize their conversation to reflect positively on themselves. Proverbs says that "As iron sharpens iron, so a man sharpens the countenance of his friend" (Proverbs 27:17). The doctor is really your friend when he tells you that you are obese and the preacher is your friend when he tells you that you are sinning. To do otherwise is to sugarcoat the truth.</p>
                    <p>All of this requires internal honesty. We must admit to ourselves what is going on inside our minds. This is what Paul did in all of his letters, most famously in Romans 7. Paul was brutally honest about himself and it jumps out at us. He was honest about his shortcomings but he also knew with absolute certainty that God would deliver him through the sacrifice of Jesus His Son.</p>
                    <p>When we let our yes be yes and no be no we reveal the honesty within us. And, like Paul, we can thank God for His grace when we realize that there are things within us that still need work.</p>
