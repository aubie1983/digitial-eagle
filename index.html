                    <h3><b>Some More Virus Thoughts</b></h3>
                    <h5>Bill Irby - <span class="w3-opacity">November 23, 2020</span></h5>
                    <p>Well the virus made a visit to Ginger and me. We have been blessed thus far to have a mild experience with it, much milder than many folks have experienced. We are thankful. So many of our friends and fellow citizens have suffered serious symptoms and wide ranging consequences of this virus. We must continue to pray for them and help when we can. Ginger and I appreciate the many kind words and offers of help.</p>
                    <p>I cannot help but think about the spiritual implications of this virus and what it is doing to folks. We all know that this is just a reminder of the truth that is always before us: life, as sweet as it is, does not go on forever. As James said, “yet you do not know what tomorrow may bring. What is your life? It is even a vapor that appears for a little time and vanishes away” (4:14).</p>
                    <p>It may seem to be somewhat negative to bring this reality to mind. But we get ourselves in all sorts of trouble when we turn our backs on the reality of life. God is the Designer of life and He designed into life the ability to teach lessons that we must learn if we are to live this life properly. Keeping the truth that life is a vapor in mind helps us value each moment we have.</p>
                    <p>Another thing that comes to mind in times like these is that God is always with us. Remember Paul‘s great sermon on Mars Hill recorded in Acts 17. He told the learned gathering that God had “made of one blood all nations of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, and determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation; that they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after Him and find Him, though He be not far from every one of us; For in Him we live, and move, and have our being” (17:26-28).</p>
                    <p>The passage teaches us that God made us and this world and that He is fully aware of the scope of possible interactions between the two creations. We cannot allow ourselves to be surprised by the challenges of this life. God has allowed multiplied thousands of examples to flood everyone’s experience to remind us of the nature of this existence. God knows we will have tough days. We must allow those days to push us closer to God. He is, after all, right close.</p>
                    <p>Of course many folks do not care for the Biblical picture of God. There are circles even within the Christian religion that see God as only beneficial in this life. The idea is that if I have to suffer any at all then God is not doing His job. Invariably all of us have to suffer. The result of that suffering can be the rejection of God. It is not true that God will protect us from all suffering. There is no Biblical example of Him operating in such a fashion. We cannot name a good Biblical character up to and including our Savior who did not suffer.</p>
                    <p>The sad truth is that people miss the blessing of believing the real truth about God. If we reject the truth about God we will never know God. The only way to know God is to know what the Bible says about Him. The living and active Word teaches us who God is. If we attempt to move through this life thinking that God is simply going to run interference against our problems we will be very disappointed.</p>
                    <p>So what should we expect from God in times like these. There are three things. One, He provides us the means to look past the immediate to the future. Things may get better and they often do. Two, He provides us the strength to face really big trouble. This strength comes from knowing the Biblical accounts of those who faced problems successfully. And three, He, through the church, provides us a fellowship of faithful believers who help us make it through the toughest of days.</p>

                    <h3><b>The Difference</b></h3>
                    <h5>Bill Irby - <span class="w3-opacity">November 17, 2020</span></h5>
                    <p>Think with me about the idea of "the difference." In subtraction (if I remember it correctly) the result of the operation is the difference. If the two numbers are close together the difference is small (5-3=2). If they are far apart the difference is big (500-100=400). This may seem a bit silly, but bare with me.</p>
                    <p>Let's think about the society of which we are a part. There was a time when those who were politically and culturally liberal in this country were not all that far from those who were more conservative. There was a significant difference to be sure but nothing like we see today. People in our Congress could find a way to work together without compromising their principles. Indeed, this country was founded and built early on by people as different from each other as were Thomas Jefferson and John Adams.</p>
                    <p>Moving to the spiritual, moral and ethical environment of our society it is not hard to see that the gaps between the various groups have widened. There was a time when almost every religious body within what is considered Christianity by most people held the view that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God in the sense that the New Testament presents Him as being. I do not think this could be said today. The differences between the varied theological positions are big.</p>
                    <p>The problem with this situation is that this is a difference that makes a really big difference. For example, my position and the position of most folks reading this article is that Jesus is God and as the Word became flesh and came to live, teach and die so that we could have access into His grace and salvation (John 1:1-4, 14, Ephesians 2, and so on). To put it plainly Jesus was then, was always before then, and is now and will always be God. There is no "wiggle room" in the Biblical picture of Jesus Christ.</p>
                    <p>If, however, we look around to the various permutations of denominational Christianity we can see Him described in different ways. Thankfully there are many who do see Him as He is Biblically described but others see Him as a sort of necessary creation of first Palestinian Jews and later the followers of Paul and some of the other apostles. It is argued that these men saw a need for a savior like Jesus and created one using the messiah stories that were popular at that time. There is a big difference between this and the Biblical reality.</p>
                    <p>There are other, much closer to home applications of this difference idea. What about the difference between a fully dedicated Christian and a person who believes and practices truth but is lukewarm in applying Christian principles to his or her life? When we start thinking about this we must remember that none of us are faultless in our practice of the Christian faith. We all come up short (Romans 3:23).</p>
                    <p>We look at the difference between a person most folks would consider good and one generally thought to be bad and we see ourselves on the good side. Then we look at folks that are outside the Biblical pattern of sound doctrine and folks we consider to be faithful and we see ourselves in the faithful portion.</p>
                    <p>Let's use this difference idea another way. What if we consider the difference between what we know is right and therefore what we ought to be doing and what we are actually doing? There is a difference that makes a personal as well as practical difference. None of us can do much about the cultural problems we face nor change the theological history of Christian belief systems. What we can have something to do with is how we practice the faith we know to be true. Perhaps we could all work on the difference between what we know to do and what we are doing. That would make a meaningful difference indeed!</p>

                    <h3><b>The Value of a Good Name</b></h3>
                    <h5>Bill Irby - <span class="w3-opacity">November 10, 2020</span></h5>
                    <p>I have told this story more than once but I feel the need to repeat it. I had walked down to the newstand in the small Virginia town where I was born and where my grandparents lived. My grandfather Irby had given me a dollar which of course I had to spend as soon as possible and the newstand had a large selection of comic books. We do not have newstands as much these days but they were wonderful places back then. I made my purchase and was walking back to the house when an older gentleman stopped me. He said, "Son, whose boy are you?" For some reason (probably because it was his dollar I had spent) I said, "My grandfather is Anslem Lee Irby." The old fellow then patted me on the head and said "Good boy."</p>
                    <p>I did not understand what had happened back then but maybe I do now. The gentleman saw a kid by himself on the street and was concerned. Once he heard my grandfather's name he was satisfied about the circumstances. That was my early introduction to the value of a good name.</p>
                    <p>The Bible has quite a bit to say about names and their significance. Ecclesiastes 7:1 has "A good name is better than precious ointment." Proverbs 22:1 reads, "A good name is to be chosen rather than great riches." God's Word teaches that a good name and the good reputation implied by a good name is more valuable that material riches.</p>
                    <p>There is a lot to see in the value of specific names in the Bible. Biblical names are usually descriptive and important. An outstanding example is God's reply to Moses in Exodus 3:14. Moses was thinking ahead about how to identify God when he spoke with the children of Israel. Moses wanted to know God's name. God identified Himself as "I AM Who I AM" and went on to say for Moses to tell them that "I AM" had sent Moses to them.</p>
                    <p>This name is without doubt the most powerfully descriptive self-identification in all of written word. "I AM" is simply the first person singular of the present tense of the verb "to be." It is an expression of a state of being that has no beginning and no end. God is. Nobody else is like God is. And all of this is wrapped up in His name.</p>
                    <p>We remember from Matthew 1 that Mary was visited by the angel of the Lord who told her what was about to happen. Two names are mentioned in that context, both with great value and importance. She was to call the baby "Jesus." That name literally means "savior." As the angel said, "for He will save His people from their sins." Matthew adds the reference to Isaiah 7:14 concerning the truth that the marriage of Joseph and Mary had not yet been consummated. "Behold, the virgin shall be with child and bear a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel." Matthew translated Immanuel for us: It means God with us.</p>
                    <p>So with the two names, Jesus and Immanuel, we have before us the  truth that Jesus is our Savior and that He was indeed God who has come here to save us. As John said, "the Word became flesh and dwelt among us" (John 1:14). Perhaps this is why Peter, filled as he was with the Holy Spirit, chose to say what he did about the name of Jesus of Nazareth before the Sanhedrin: "Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name given among men by which we must be saved" (Acts 4:12).</p>
                    <p>The apostle Paul knew that his choice to live by the name of Jesus was the right one. We can know the same thing. People in the here and now might not agree but one day they will know. Philippians 2:9 hearkens back to the naming of Jesus and says that "God has given Him the name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth and those under the earth, and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father." What a name!</p>
